# Part 5 Backend Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

## 🎯 Overview
Successfully built the complete backend for the Driver & Vehicle Management System!

---

## ✅ What We Built (Backend)

### **1. Vehicle Model** (`backend/src/models/Vehicle.model.js`)
**Functions:**
- ✅ `create(vehicleData)` - Add new vehicle with duplicate plate check
- ✅ `findById(id)` - Get vehicle with owner details
- ✅ `findByUserId(userId)` - Get all user's vehicles
- ✅ `findAllActive()` - Get all active vehicles (for browsing)
- ✅ `update(id, userId, updates)` - Update vehicle (owner only)
- ✅ `delete(id, userId)` - Delete vehicle (owner only)
- ✅ `countByUserId(userId)` - Count user's vehicles
- ✅ `checkLicensePlateExists(plate)` - Check duplicate plates
- ✅ `findByIdWithUser(id)` - Get vehicle with full user object

**Features:**
- Automatic license plate uppercase conversion
- Duplicate license plate detection
- Owner verification before update/delete
- Cascade delete when user is deleted

---

### **2. Vehicle Controller** (`backend/src/controllers/vehicle.controller.js`)
**Endpoints:**
1. ✅ `POST /api/vehicles` - Add new vehicle
   - Validates all fields
   - Checks license plate uniqueness
   - Validates seat range (1-8)
   - Returns created vehicle

2. ✅ `GET /api/vehicles/my-vehicles` - Get user's vehicles
   - Returns array of vehicles
   - Ordered by created_at DESC

3. ✅ `GET /api/vehicles/:id` - Get single vehicle
   - Returns vehicle with owner details
   - 404 if not found

4. ✅ `PUT /api/vehicles/:id` - Update vehicle
   - Owner verification
   - Validates updated fields
   - Returns updated vehicle

5. ✅ `DELETE /api/vehicles/:id` - Delete vehicle
   - Owner verification
   - Returns deleted vehicle
   - 404 if not found or unauthorized

6. ✅ `GET /api/vehicles` - Get all active vehicles
   - For browsing/discovery
   - Includes owner info

7. ✅ `GET /api/vehicles/count` - Get vehicle count
   - Returns user's active vehicle count

**Validation:**
- All fields required (model, color, license_plate, total_seats)
- License plate must be alphanumeric
- Seats must be 1-8
- Owner verification for update/delete

---

### **3. Vehicle Routes** (`backend/src/routes/vehicle.routes.js`)
**All routes protected** (require JWT authentication)

```
POST   /api/vehicles              Add vehicle
GET    /api/vehicles/my-vehicles  Get user's vehicles
GET    /api/vehicles/count        Get vehicle count
GET    /api/vehicles              Get all vehicles
GET    /api/vehicles/:id          Get single vehicle
PUT    /api/vehicles/:id          Update vehicle
DELETE /api/vehicles/:id          Delete vehicle
```

**Route Order Important:**
- `/my-vehicles` before `/:id` (to avoid route conflict)
- `/count` before `/:id`

---

### **4. Driver Mode Toggle** (`backend/src/controllers/auth.controller.js`)
**New Endpoint:**
- ✅ `PUT /api/auth/toggle-driver`
  - Accepts: `{ is_driver: true/false }`
  - Validates user has at least one vehicle before enabling
  - Returns error: "Add a vehicle first" if no vehicles
  - Updates user's is_driver status
  - Returns updated user object

**Updated User Model:**
- ✅ `updateDriverStatus(id, isDriver)` method added
  - Updates is_driver field
  - Returns full user object with driver fields

---

## 📂 Files Created/Modified

### Created:
1. `backend/src/models/Vehicle.model.js` (300+ lines)
2. `backend/src/controllers/vehicle.controller.js` (200+ lines)
3. `backend/src/routes/vehicle.routes.js`

### Modified:
4. `backend/src/routes/index.js` - Added vehicle routes
5. `backend/src/controllers/auth.controller.js` - Added toggleDriverMode
6. `backend/src/models/User.model.js` - Added updateDriverStatus
7. `backend/src/routes/auth.routes.js` - Added toggle-driver route

---

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Users Table (Modified):
```sql
is_driver BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
driver_rating DECIMAL(3,2) DEFAULT 5.00
total_rides_as_driver INTEGER DEFAULT 0
```

### Vehicles Table (New):
```sql
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
user_id INTEGER (FK to users)
model VARCHAR(50)
color VARCHAR(20)
license_plate VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE
total_seats INTEGER (1-8)
is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
created_at TIMESTAMP
updated_at TIMESTAMP
```

**Indexes:**
- `idx_vehicles_user_id` - Fast user lookup
- `idx_vehicles_license_plate` - Fast uniqueness check
- `idx_vehicles_active` - Filter active vehicles

---

## 🔐 Security Features
- ✅ All routes protected with JWT authentication
- ✅ Owner verification before update/delete
- ✅ License plate uniqueness enforced
- ✅ SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization

## 🧪 Next Steps - Testing

### 1. Run Migration
```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor
# Copy and paste: backend/database/migrations/part5-driver-vehicles.sql
# Click "Run"
```

### 2. Test Migration
```bash
cd backend
node database/test-migration-part5.js
```

### 3. Restart Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

### 4. Test with Frontend
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/vehicles
2. Add a new vehicle
3. View vehicles list
4. Update vehicle
5. Delete vehicle
6. Toggle driver mode (will require vehicle first)

---

## 📝 API Testing Examples

### Add Vehicle:
```bash
POST http://localhost:5000/api/vehicles
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <token>
Body:
{
  "model": "Honda City",
  "color": "White",
  "license_plate": "TN01AB1234",
  "total_seats": 4
}
```

### Get My Vehicles:
```bash
GET http://localhost:5000/api/vehicles/my-vehicles
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

### Toggle Driver Mode:
```bash
PUT http://localhost:5000/api/auth/toggle-driver
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <token>
Body:
{
  "is_driver": true
}
```
