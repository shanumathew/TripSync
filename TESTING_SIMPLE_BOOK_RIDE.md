## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### ❌ "No route appearing on map"

**Check:**
1. Both pickup and dropoff selected?
2. Open console (F12) - any errors?
3. Is Google Maps loaded? (Do you see the map?)

**Fix:**
- Make sure **Directions API** is enabled in Google Cloud
- Check if `window.google` exists in console
- Wait a few seconds for route to calculate

---

### ❌ "Book Ride button disabled"

**Cause**: Need to select both locations

**Fix**: Select both pickup and dropoff from dropdowns

---

### ❌ "Failed to create ride" error

**Check:**
1. Backend server running? (`npm start` in backend folder)
2. Check terminal for backend errors
3. Open browser console - what error?

**Common issues:**
- Backend not running
- Database connection issue
- Auth token expired (re-login)

---

## 🔍 What Happens When You Click "Book Ride"

### 1. Frontend creates ride data:
```javascript
{
  pickup_location: "Connaught Place",
  pickup_lat: 28.6315,
  pickup_lng: 77.2167,
  dropoff_location: "India Gate",
  dropoff_lat: 28.6129,
  dropoff_lng: 77.2295,
  fare: 48,
  distance: "3.2 km",
  estimated_duration: "12 mins"
}
```

### 2. API call: `POST /api/rides`
- Sends ride data to backend
- Backend creates ride in database
- Returns ride ID

### 3. Redirect to tracking page: `/track/{rideId}`
- Shows PassengerTracking component
- Real-time driver location (if driver assigned)
- ETA countdown
- Status updates

---

## 🚨 Backend Must Be Running

Before booking a ride, make sure backend is running:

```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

You should see:
```
🚀 Server running on http://localhost:5000
✅ Database connected

```
